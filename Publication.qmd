Early faulty detection in air quality sensors is of increasing importance in ensuring reliable and accurate air quality readings. These sensors play a critical role in monitoring the pollution levels in the atmosphere however, due to their exposure to harsh weather, itâ€™s natural that they will face wear and may require periodical servicing. The devices are rarely monitored in most cases, particularly in Uganda. The objective of this research is to build a model for the early detection of faulty sensors for replacement and repair. Using the unsupervised learning approaches in particular K-means and PCA; we train a predictive model and later evaluate it for accuracy using a test dataset. From the cluster analysis, the research identified 3 clusters that are; the health state cluster, nearing fault state cluster, and the faulty state cluster. The research discovered that there is no significant difference in adopting PCA as a preprocessing step in using the K-means algorithm. The research further recommended other clustering methods to be used to compare the accuracy score. It also recommended using more attributes for PCA to be effective.
